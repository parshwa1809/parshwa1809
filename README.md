# Hi there, I'm Parshwa Shah! 👋

### Assistant Product Manager | Agentic AI & RAG Builder | Cloud Architect

I sit at the intersection of **Product Strategy** and **Engineering**. With a Master's from **UT Dallas** and a background in Computer Engineering, I bridge the gap between complex AI capabilities and real-world business value.

I don't just define the vision for intelligent systems; I possess the technical depth to architect and build them—from **Agentic AI** pipelines to **AWS** infrastructure.
